# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your willingness to contribute to us. Since this project is divided into several different parts, here is a guide to the contribution guide:

- [Server Guide](./docs/server-develop-zh.md)

Our requirements for code quality are not that high. Generally speaking, as long as your code can run normally, we will accept it. However, you still need to write corresponding automated tests to ensure the maintainability and correctness of your code.

We sincerely hope that you can find joy in participating in the project contribution.
