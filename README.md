OurChat is a chat application for Linux, Windows and Macos. It provides a web client, a app client written in python and a client written in rust(use Tauri).

The web client is written in Rust(both frontend and backend),using yew framework.Because of wasm,it has a good performance.

The project is under rapid development and there is also a lot of work to be done. It can not be used directly by now.
